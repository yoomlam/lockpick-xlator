# CIVIL DSL Specification

**Civic Instructions & Validations Intermediate Language**

This specification is the authoritative what and why of the DSL. It includes design rationale, goals, full syntax narrative, examples of all constructs, compilation targets, jurisdiction layering. It is written in prose with embedded YAML examples.

* Read CIVIL_DSL_spec.md to understand the DSL
* Read civil-quickref.md to write a CIVIL module (used by AI)

## Introduction

Below is a **basic, practical DSL** aimed at government policy/regulation logic (eligibility + tax instructions) that's easy to **transpile** later to OPA/Rego, DMN, Drools, etc. It's designed around: **jurisdiction + effective dates + citations + explainability**.

This specification defines **CIVIL** (Civic Instructions & Validations Intermediate Language), the target architecture for Xlator's policy rule engine.

---

Design goals
------------

-   **Policy-native metadata**: jurisdiction, authority, citations, effective dates, version.
-   **Deterministic evaluation**: no hidden state; input facts → outputs.
-   **Layering**: federal baseline + state + city overrides/stricter rules.
-   **Explainability**: rules emit _reasons_ with citations.
-   **Transpiler-friendly**: simple AST, minimal syntax sugar.

---

Core concepts
-------------

### 1) Inputs are typed “facts”

Facts are the only input; the engine is a pure function:

`evaluate(policy_bundle, facts, as_of_date, jurisdiction) -> decisions + reasons`

### 2) Outputs are “decisions”

Decisions can be boolean, enum, numeric, or structured objects.

### 3) Rules are “when/then” with a reason

A rule can:

-   set a decision (`eligible = true`)
-   compute derived values (`agi = ...`)
-   emit instructions (`instructions += [...]`)
-   add violations/reasons (`reasons += reason(...)`)

### 4) Policy bundle supports versions + effective dates

Quarterly updates become a new policy bundle version, not in-place edits.

---

DSL structure (high level)
--------------------------

-   `policy_bundle`: a versioned collection of modules
-   `module`: scoped to domain (eligibility, tax, etc.)
-   `definitions`: types, constants, tables
-   `rule_set`: rules + precedence strategy

---

Syntax (YAML-like, transpiler-friendly)
---------------------------------------

### Policy bundle skeleton

```yaml
bundle: "civics:benefits"
version: "2026Q1"
effective:
  start: 2026-01-01
  end: 2026-03-31
jurisdiction:
  level: federal
  country: US

modules:
  - file: eligibility/housing_assistance.civil.yaml
  - file: tax/filing_basics.civil.yaml
```

---

Module format
-------------

### 1) Types + fact schema

```yaml
module: "eligibility.housing_assistance"
description: "Housing Assistance eligibility rules"
jurisdiction: { level: federal, country: US }

facts:
  Applicant:
    fields:
      age: { type: int }
      resident: { type: bool }
      household_size: { type: int }
      annual_income: { type: money, currency: USD }
      city: { type: string }
      state: { type: string }

decisions:
  eligible: { type: bool, default: false }
  reasons:  { type: list, item: Reason, default: [] }

types:
  # Optional 'description:' is supported on fact fields, decision fields,
  # table definitions, rule_set, and individual rules.
  Reason:
    fields:
      code: { type: string }
      message: { type: string }
      citations: { type: list, item: Citation }
  Citation:
    fields:
      label: { type: string }      # e.g., "42 USC § 1437a"
      url: { type: string, optional: true }
      excerpt: { type: string, optional: true }  # keep short
```

### 2) Constants + tables

```yaml
constants:
  MIN_AGE: 18

tables:
  income_limit_by_household:
    key: [household_size]
    value: [max_income]
    rows:
      - { household_size: 1, max_income: 35000 }
      - { household_size: 2, max_income: 42000 }
      - { household_size: 3, max_income: 48000 }
```

### 2b) Computed values (CIVIL v2)

The `computed:` section defines intermediate derived values using CIVIL expressions. Unlike `decisions:`, computed values are not primary outputs — they are results available to `rules:` (in `when:` expressions) and to other `computed:` fields.

```yaml
computed:
  earned_income_deduction:
    type: money
    currency: USD
    description: "20% of earned income (7 CFR § 273.9(b))"
    expr: "Household.earned_income * EARNED_INCOME_DEDUCTION_RATE"

  is_exempt_household:
    type: bool
    description: "Elderly or disabled — exempt from gross test and shelter cap"
    expr: "Household.has_elderly_member || Household.has_disabled_member"

  shelter_deduction:
    type: money
    description: "Shelter deduction, capped unless exempt"
    conditional:
      if: "is_exempt_household"
      then: "shelter_excess"
      else: "min(shelter_excess, SHELTER_DEDUCTION_CAP)"
```

Each field uses either `expr:` (a single expression) or `conditional:` (if/then/else). Define fields in dependency order — no forward references.

**Expression language additions in `computed:` fields:**
- `max(a, b)` — maps to Rego `max([a, b])`
- `min(a, b)` — maps to Rego `min([a, b])`
- Other computed field names referenced by bare identifier (e.g., `shelter_excess`)

---

### 2c) Review blocks (optional, on rules and computed fields)

`review:` blocks attach extraction quality scores to individual rules and computed fields. All four integer fields are required when the block is present. Scores have no effect on transpilation or OPA evaluation — they exist only for human review.

```yaml
review:
  extraction_fidelity: int  # 1–5: how accurately the AI captured the policy intent
  source_clarity: int       # 1–5: how clear and unambiguous the source policy text was
  logic_complexity: int     # 1–5: number of conditions, boolean depth, table lookups
  policy_complexity: int    # 1–5: density of legalese, cross-references, exceptions
  notes: string             # optional; required for any score ≤ 2 or ≥ 4
```

Score scale: 1 = very low · 3 = moderate · 5 = very high.

Example on a rule:

```yaml
rules:
  - id: "FED-SNAP-DENY-001"
    kind: deny
    priority: 1
    when: "Household.gross_monthly_income > gross_limit"
    then:
      - add_reason:
          code: GROSS_INCOME_EXCEEDED
          message: "Gross income exceeds the 130% FPL limit"
    review:
      extraction_fidelity: 5
      source_clarity: 5
      logic_complexity: 2
      policy_complexity: 1
      notes: "Direct threshold test; formula explicit in 7 CFR § 273.9(a)(1)"
```

---

### 2d) Source provenance (optional, on fact fields, computed fields, tables, and rules)

The `source:` field records where in the source policy document an element was defined. It is a plain free-text string — typically a CFR section plus heading. Its value is purely for human traceability; it has no effect on transpilation or OPA evaluation.

```yaml
source: "7 CFR § 273.9(a)(1) — Gross Income Test"
```

**Where it applies:** `FactField`, `ComputedField`, `TableDef`, `Rule`.

**Where it does not apply:** `FactEntity` (container, not a leaf definition), `DecisionField` (output), `constants` (untyped dict).

**`source:` vs `citations:` distinction:**

| Field | Purpose | Audience |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `source:` (on field/table/rule) | Where in the policy doc this element was *extracted from* — developer traceability | CIVIL authors, auditors |
| `citations:` (in add_reason actions) | Legal authority shown in *denial explanations to applicants* | End users, caseworkers |

A deny rule will often have the same CFR section in both. That is expected — they serve different audiences.

Example on a fact field, computed field, table, and rule:

```yaml
facts:
  Household:
    fields:
      gross_monthly_income:
        type: money
        currency: USD
        description: "Total gross monthly income before deductions"
        source: "7 CFR § 273.9(a) — Income and Deductions"

computed:
  gross_income_exceeds_limit:
    type: bool
    expr: "Household.gross_monthly_income > gross_limit"
    source: "7 CFR § 273.9(a)(1) — Gross Income Test"

tables:
  gross_income_limits:
    key: [household_size]
    value: [monthly_limit]
    source: "7 CFR § 273.9(a)(1) — Gross Income Limits Table"
    rows:
      - { household_size: 1, monthly_limit: 1580 }

rules:
  - id: "FED-SNAP-DENY-GROSS"
    kind: deny
    priority: 1
    source: "7 CFR § 273.9(a)(1) — Gross Income Test"
    when: "gross_income_exceeds_limit"
    then:
      - add_reason:
          code: GROSS_INCOME_EXCEEDED
          message: "Gross income exceeds the 130% FPL limit."
          citations:
            - { label: "7 CFR § 273.9(a)(1)" }
```

---

### 3) Rule set

```yaml
rule_set:
  name: "federal_eligibility"
  description: "Federal housing assistance eligibility"  # optional
  precedence: "deny_overrides_allow"   # other options: allow_overrides_deny, first_match, priority_order

rules:
  - id: "FED-RESIDENCY"
    kind: "deny"
    description: "Applicant must be a US resident"  # optional
    when: "Applicant.resident == false"
    then:
      - add_reason:
          code: "NOT_RESIDENT"
          message: "Applicant must be a resident."
          citations:
            - { label: "42 USC § 1437a" }

  - id: "FED-MIN-AGE"
    kind: "deny"
    when: "Applicant.age < MIN_AGE"
    then:
      - add_reason:
          code: "UNDERAGE"
          message: "Applicant must be at least 18 years old."
          citations:
            - { label: "24 CFR § 5.403" }

  - id: "FED-INCOME"
    kind: "deny"
    when: "Applicant.annual_income > table('income_limit_by_household', Applicant.household_size).max_income"
    then:
      - add_reason:
          code: "INCOME_TOO_HIGH"
          message: "Income exceeds the limit for household size."
          citations:
            - { label: "24 CFR § 5.609" }

  - id: "FED-ALLOW"
    kind: "allow"
    when: "true"
    then:
      - set: { eligible: true }
```

**Available `then:` action types:**

| Action | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| `set: { decision: value }` | Set a decision output to a value |
| `add_reason: { code, message, citations }` | Append a Reason to a list-typed decision |
| `add_instruction: { step, message, citations }` | Append an Instruction to a list-typed decision |
| `add_to_set: { decision: value }` | Add a value to a set-typed decision |
| `append_to_list: { decision: value }` | Append a value to a list-typed decision |

Each `then:` entry must have exactly one action type.

**Notes for transpilers**

-   `kind: deny/allow` makes compilation easy to “deny wins” logic (OPA style) or DMN hit policies.
-   `add_reason` gives explainability without needing an engine-specific tracer.
-   `table()` is declarative and maps to DMN tables, Rego data, or Drools facts.

Jurisdiction layering (federal → state → city)
----------------------------------------------

> **Implementation status:** Overlay bundles are defined in this spec but are not yet validated by `tools/validate_civil.py` or transpiled by `tools/transpile_to_opa.py`. The validator and transpiler operate on individual CIVIL modules only.

You’ll want a _composition DSL_ that defines how modules merge.

### Overlay bundle example (Illinois overrides)

```yaml
bundle: "civics:benefits"
version: "2026Q1"
effective: { start: 2026-01-01, end: 2026-03-31 }
jurisdiction: { level: state, country: US, state: IL }

overlays:
  - target_module: "eligibility.housing_assistance"
    strategy: "add_stricter_denials"     # other: replace_rule_set, override_by_id
    rules:
      - id: "IL-INCOME-ADJUST"
        kind: "deny"
        when: "Applicant.annual_income > 45000 && Applicant.household_size == 3"
        then:
          - add_reason:
              code: "IL_INCOME_TOO_HIGH"
              message: "Illinois sets a lower income cap for household size 3."
              citations:
                - { label: "305 ILCS 5/xx-x" }
```

### City overlay example (Chicago adds requirement)

```yaml
bundle: "civics:benefits"
version: "2026Q1"
jurisdiction: { level: city, country: US, state: IL, city: Chicago }
effective: { start: 2026-01-01, end: 2026-03-31 }

overlays:
  - target_module: "eligibility.housing_assistance"
    strategy: "add_stricter_denials"
    rules:
      - id: "CHI-RESIDENCY-DURATION"
        kind: "deny"
        when: "Applicant.resident == true && Applicant.residency_months < 6"
        then:
          - add_reason:
              code: "CHI_RESIDENCY_TOO_SHORT"
              message: "Chicago requires 6+ months of residency."
              citations:
                - { label: "Chicago Municipal Code § x-x-x" }
```

To support this, the fact schema can include `Applicant.residency_months`.

---

Tax filing instructions example
-------------------------------

Taxes often need:
-   computed values
-   conditional instructions
-   outputs beyond booleans

### Module

```yaml
module: "tax.filing_basics"
jurisdiction: { level: federal, country: US }

facts:
  Taxpayer:
    fields:
      filing_status: { type: enum, values: [single, mfj, mfs, hoh] }
      age: { type: int }
      has_w2: { type: bool }
      has_1099: { type: bool }
      self_employed: { type: bool }
      gross_income: { type: money, currency: USD }
      withholding: { type: money, currency: USD }

decisions:
  must_file: { type: bool, default: false }
  forms:     { type: set, item: string, default: [] }
  instructions: { type: list, item: Instruction, default: [] }
  reasons:   { type: list, item: Reason, default: [] }

types:
  Instruction:
    fields:
      step: { type: string }
      message: { type: string }
      citations: { type: list, item: Citation }
```

### Rules

```yaml
constants:
  SINGLE_THRESHOLD: 14600   # example placeholder

rule_set:
  name: "filing_requirement"
  precedence: "priority_order"

rules:
  - id: "ADD-FORM-1040"
    kind: "allow"
    priority: 10
    when: "true"
    then:
      - add_to_set: { forms: "Form 1040" }

  - id: "SELF_EMPLOYED_SCHEDULE_C"
    kind: "allow"
    priority: 20
    when: "Taxpayer.self_employed == true"
    then:
      - add_to_set: { forms: "Schedule C" }
      - add_instruction:
          step: "Report self-employment income"
          message: "Complete Schedule C for business income/expenses."
          citations:
            - { label: "IRS Instructions for Schedule C" }

  - id: "MUST_FILE_SINGLE"
    kind: "allow"
    priority: 30
    when: "Taxpayer.filing_status == 'single' && Taxpayer.gross_income >= SINGLE_THRESHOLD"
    then:
      - set: { must_file: true }
      - add_reason:
          code: "INCOME_OVER_THRESHOLD"
          message: "Gross income meets or exceeds the filing threshold."
          citations:
            - { label: "26 USC § 6012" }
```

This is intentionally “instructional”—it outputs forms/instructions, not just allow/deny.

---

Expression language (minimal)
-----------------------------

Keep it small so you can transpile to almost anything:

-   literals: numbers, strings, booleans, dates
-   field access: `Applicant.age`
-   boolean ops: `&& || !`
-   comparisons: `== != < <= > >=`
-   arithmetic: `+ - * /`
-   functions:
    -   `table(name, key...).field`
    -   `in(value, [a,b,c])`
    -   `exists(field)` / `is_null(field)`
    -   `date("YYYY-MM-DD")`, `between(date, start, end)`
    -   `max(a, b)`, `min(a, b)` — numeric comparison (CIVIL v2; for `computed:` fields)

---

Compilation targets (how this maps later)
-----------------------------------------

This DSL is basically an **intermediate representation**:

-   **OPA/Rego**: rules become derived booleans/sets; tables become data; reasons become structured outputs.
-   **DMN**: tables map directly; precedence maps to hit policies; reason codes become outputs.
-   **Drools**: facts are working memory; rules map to LHS/RHS; reasons are inserted.

Because you’ve separated:
-   metadata
-   tables/constants
-   pure expressions
-   deterministic actions (`set`, `add_reason`, `add_instruction`)

…you’re not locked in.

---

What I’d build first (minimum viable)
-------------------------------------

1.  **Parser** (YAML → AST) with schema validation
2.  **Reference interpreter** (slow but correct) to run tests
3.  **Golden test harness** (fixtures per jurisdiction + quarter)
4.  **Transpiler** to your first engine once semantics stabilize

The reference interpreter is critical: it becomes your “semantic source of truth” while you swap engines.

---

Possible next steps:
-   a formal EBNF-style grammar (if you prefer a text syntax over YAML),
-   a precise precedence/merge algorithm for overlays,
-   and a canonical JSON AST shape to make the transpiler straightforward.
